            <h2>What is NXT?</h2>
            <p>Nxt Museum is the first museum in the Netherlands dedicated to new media art.
                We focus on art that uses modern tools to embody the modern age.
                We believe that the tools used in artistic expression reflect the times we live in.
                That makes them the perfect tool to understand today's complexity,
                allowing us to recognize our reality,
                relate and be able to think about it.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Nxt Museum is the first museum in the Netherlands that focuses entirely on media art.
                We exhibit works of art that make use of modern technologies of today and of the future.
                Because art reflects the zeitgeist,
                we believe that the most innovative art gives us the opportunity to think about the impact of
                technological developments.
                A moment of reflection in a reality that is developing faster and faster</p>

            <h2>What to do?</h2>
            <p>Movement. Sound. Light.
                A sudden change in your environment can trigger an inescapable reaction,
                a primal reaction. It is involuntary.
                It's irrational. It's natural.
                We can't control it,
                it's how the human body is wired.
                Art engages our senses.
                It brings ideas,
                emotions and stories about.
                Changing and synthesizing our perceptions into new perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Where is it?</h2>
            <p>The space is located in Amsterdam-Noord and is purpose-built to explore new media art;
                Art that expands technical possibilities and applications,
                is dynamic and formless and generates movement,
                physically, mentally and emotionally. The space offers all the ingredients to grow these progressive art
                forms,
